# Punisher

Punish your database to uncover its weaknesses.

This is a work in progress. Eventually there will be a number of tools that
attempt to provide load, failure and recovery scenarios that will enable
you to gauge the strengths and weaknesses of a given database.

## Why?

It seems many databases today maintain many claims about their performance
and the nature of their ACID compliance. But distinguishing between
marketing and verifiable truth is difficult. Punisher seeks to change this,
and provide you with the tools to confirm things for yourself.
